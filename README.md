## Features

better readability when it comes to dealing with errors versus non errors, for example, "<span style="color:red">**assert**</span>" is a bold dark red, while "<span style="color:lightyellow">**Print**</span>" is a bold Bright off-white color. little things like this make code easier to read and easy to pay attention to whats important and whats not. the keyword "local" practically looks like a comment because in my non-proffesional opinion, its completely unnessesary because i never-dont use local for variables.

## Requirements

none? not sure lol this is just used for the Luau roblox language

## Extension Settings
none, may add some in the future
## Known Issues
its common for other extensions to overwrite some things in this one, so i am working on making this extension work for .luaux files.
